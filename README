Aws CloudfrontSecure
===================

Plugin to allow for Custom Policy-based downloads from Amazon CloudFront, useful for paid-download scenarios.

This allows you to easily provide CDN downloads for files restricted to expiration dates & IP addresses.

Requirements
============
  sudo gem install right_aws
  sudo gem install right_http_connection

Built for right_aws v2.0.0 and right_http_connection v1.2.4


Credits & References
====================
This is a reopenning of the same class from the right_aws gem.
http://rightaws.rubyforge.org/right_aws_gem_doc/

Strongly based on wiseleyb's fork: http://github.com/wiseleyb/right_aws
with the addition of Canned Policies, which permit IP restrictions.


Usage
=====

You can either use the class methods, which requires passing in all parameters,
or create one instance and pass only the varying parameters.

If you're unfamiliar with CloudFront, you'll need that 100% set up first:
http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/index.html

You can put your AWS CF public key (the .pem file) in:
RAILS_ROOT/config/cloudfront_keys/

Examples
=======
cf_distro = RightAws::AcfInterface::AcfDistribution.new(
     'http://jnefoi457dfje.cloudfront.net/','JFEASDFJIKFASDFOENFDS','pk-JFEASDFJIKFASDFOENFDS.pem'
)

cf_distro.get_private_download_url(
     :resource => 'my_protected_song.mp3',
     :ip_address => '12.34.56.78',
     :expires =>  3.hours.from_now
)
